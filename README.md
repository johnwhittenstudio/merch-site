## Description <a id="description"></a>

This is a practice exercise for making a React website with full CRUD functionality. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete items in the store. Items should have fields for name, description, and quantity (along with any other fields you wish to add).

Increase or decrease the quantity of an item in the store. For instance, if a user clicks "Buy", the quantity will decrease by one. If a user clicks "Restock", it will increment by a specified number.

When the quantity of an item is reduced to 0, the item should say "Out of Stock". A user should not be able to reduce the quantity of an item below 0.

#### _Further Exploration_
Create a Cart component. When a user clicks "Buy", the specified item should be added to the cart.

A user should be able to view and remove items from the cart.

Create a widget that shows the number of items in the cart. This widget should be updated when items are added to the cart.
